            <p>
               You have permission to copy, modify, propagate, and distribute
               a work formed by combining OpenSSL with KVIrc, or a work
               derivative of such a combination, even if such copying,
               modification, propagation, or distribution would otherwise
               violate the terms of the GPL. You must comply with the GPL
               in all respects for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.
            </p>

            <p>
               You may include this OpenSSL Exception and its grant of
               permissions when you distribute KVIrc. Inclusion of this notice
               with such a distribution constitutes a grant of such permission.
               If you do not wish to grant these permissions, remove this
               section entitled &quot;OpenSSL Exception&quot; from your distribution.
